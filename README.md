## Summary
One drawback of the webpage pertains to the filter function on the code, where data is needed to filer values of each column to display values using the html code. This method would benefit an analyst who is familiar with the data but it would not be useful for someone who is trying to view the data (e.g. Stakeholder or client). The data should be visualized in a more practical way.

Two recommendations for further development:
 1. Filter the data in a more functional way (e.g. filter by date, filter by data trend) to present the data in a more interactive/approachable way.
 2. Embed filters available for users viewing the data inplace of the input method that curently exists to create a more practical user interaction with the data. This change will help the user explore the data with ease compared to the structure available in the code currently.
